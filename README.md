# Time difference
This program calculates time difference between two given dates.  
Difference is available in: *Years, Months, Days, Hours, Minutes, Seconds, Milliseconds*.  
Also it can be shown in format `X years, Y months, Z days`.  
For now the given dates can be in the format `YYYY-MM-DD`.  
HTML page does not look nice but it's enough for the job. I'm lazy to do the front :)
